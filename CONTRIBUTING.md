# Contributing to Krishna Connect

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Krishna Connect. It's people like you that make such a project possible. Your contributions are invaluable to us.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Krishna Connect itself.

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Sharmamayankkkk/krishna-connect/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Sharmamayankkkk/krishna-connect/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Read the documentation** carefully and make sure your suggestion is not already covered.
- **Perform a cursory search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed enhancement, why it's needed, and how it would be used.

### Code Contribution

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/krishna-connect.git
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
4.  **Make your changes**. Ensure you follow the existing code style.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
6.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.
8.  Provide a clear title and description for your Pull Request, explaining the changes and linking to any relevant issues.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style. We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain a consistent style.
- Ensure your code is well-commented where necessary.
