## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running for development and contribution.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account.
- A Google Cloud account with the Gemini API enabled.
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) (optional, for deployment)

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sharmamayankkkk/krishna-connect.git
cd krishna-connect
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1.  **Create a Supabase Project**: Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), create a new project, and save your **Project URL** and `public` **anon key**. You'll find these in your project's *Settings > API*.
2.  **Database Schema**: Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql` from this repository and run it to set up your database tables, policies, and functions.
3.  **Clean Database (Optional)**: To start with a clean slate at any time, you can run the script in `supabase/reset.sql` in the SQL Editor. **Warning: This will delete all data.**
4.  **Enable OAuth Providers (Optional)**: If you want to use Google or Facebook login, you'll need to enable them in *Authentication > Providers* in your Supabase dashboard and add your OAuth credentials.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. You can copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then, fill in the values in `.env.local` with the credentials from your Supabase and Google Cloud projects:

```
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Google AI (Gemini)
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### 4. Install Dependencies and Run

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Now, you need to run two processes in separate terminals:
1.  **The main Next.js app:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **The Genkit AI development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You're all set to start developing!

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Make sure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Import Project on Vercel**: Import your repository into Vercel. It will automatically detect that you are using Next.js and configure the build settings.
3.  **Add Environment Variables**: In your Vercel project settings (*Settings > Environment Variables*), add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` variables with the same values from your `.env.local` file.
4.  **Deploy**: Vercel will build and deploy your application. Any push to the main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.
