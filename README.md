## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for the database and authentication.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/krishna-connect.git
cd krishna-connect
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1.  **Create a Supabase Project**: Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), create a new project, and save your **Project URL** and `public` **anon key**.

2.  **Database Schema**: Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard and run the SQL scripts required to set up your database tables and policies.
    *You can find the schema in your Supabase project settings if you've already configured it, or you can create them based on the types in `src/lib/types.ts`.*

3.  **Clean Database (Optional)**: To start with a clean slate, you can run the script in `supabase/reset.sql` in the SQL Editor. This will truncate all data while keeping the table structure.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

### 4. Install Dependencies and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
